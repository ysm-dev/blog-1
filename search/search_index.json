I genuinely believe that we are always making choices and that we have the ability to choose. Choosing can be terrifying because it means we are accountable for our decisions, and there are infinite options before us. It is also frightening because once we have made a decision, we must live with it, it is the death of optionality. But I believe that choosing is the only way to live authentically.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Existential Despair: A feeling of hopelessness rooted in the existentialist belief that life lacks inherent meaning.

They put both of them into an MRI and told them they were going to get shocked at some random time in the future. What they found was that regular people would have an anxious baseline response minutes before they were going to get shocked, but when they did, it was only slightly higher than the baseline.</p> <p>The monks, however, had no resting anxious anticipatory response. There was no overactive brain activity until the moment of the shock. But when they did feel the shock, it was much higher than the group of regular people. They felt more pain!</p> <p>The lesson I learned from this is that anticipation likely dampens the sensations at the moment life happens, but at the cost dampening the joy as well, while creating a contraction in the present moment. This relates to the pessimism bit. You might think you're winning because you believe the pain was lessened by expecting the worse, but you also lose because you were in anticipation the entire time. On the same token letting go of anticipation of success also allows you to enjoy the moment more, the pressure to succeed is equally a contraction.</p>"},{"location":"writing/2024/06/01/advice-to-young-people/#you-were-just-a-child","title":"You were just a child","text":"<p>Stuck with me for a bit.

I hope you can see, as a member of reality, that I write this sincerely.</p> <p></p> <p>\u2014</p> Preamble <p>Also, I wrote this as a speech-to-text conversion. As I mentioned in my advice post about writing more, my measure for writing more is simply putting more words on a page. If you're wondering how I can be so vulnerable, it's the same as what I mentioned about confidence. If you think this comment hurt me remember that you're just a mirror.</p> <p>I've also learned that writing is a exorcism of your own thoughts. The more I write, the less these thoughts stick around in my head.</p> <p>Maybe if you knew my background you\u2019d understand why I wrote that piece. When I was younger, I had so little in my life that I hated anyone who had anything. I used to be jealous of people who were able to have conversations with their families during dinner or the holidays because their parents did not work retail jobs. I also envied those who received Christmas and birthday gifts.</p> <p>My parents were always working, so I haven't spent much time with them and resented them for not teaching me any life lessons. We didn't have much money, so whenever I needed something like a winter jacket or a pair of shoes, I had to choose between skipping my birthday or Christmas, or both. This was the case when I got my first cell phone in high school.</p> <p>When I came to the US, I had about ~$1000 saved up. I asked my employer if I could get my first week's pay in advance so that I could pay the deposit for the apartment I was going to rent.</p> <p>Four years into working, I pushed myself too hard and developed tendonitsis in both of my hands. I couldn't code or even hold a glass of beer. I thought I would lose my job.</p> <p>Everyone's suffering is maximum to them</p> <p>I'm not here to compare suffering. I'm just trying to explain maybe the pre-training that went into my mental model of the world, and how it might have influenced what I wrote in that article. There no medal for the sad olympics. No one wins.</p> <p>I thought the only thing I wanted was to make money so I wouldn't feel poor, because I didn't want to be like my parents. They would get into fights over late fees on the electrical bill, which meant less money for groceries. Even that was going to be taken away from me. I'm going to lose everything I told myself. At that time, I was clawing away at patriarchical self esteem and my only self worth as attached to money and work, and now, injured I thought I'd have nothing, again.</p> <p>Those were the stories I told myself.</p> <p>The advice I wrote in that article, dedicated to my sister going back to college? They were truly the lies I told myself to get through it.</p> <p>I want her to believe that you can just choose to be happy because the absence of choice is too dreadful.</p> <p>Her life is very different than mine, my parents hae not materially supported me since I moved out when I was 17. I told myself I was a man and that they could just save the money and spend it on her.</p> <p>Since then, I've known the price of every piece of clothing on my back. I know the price of every meal I've ever eaten. The reason I talk so much about money in my life is that I'm always keeping track of what I have and what I might lose.</p> <p>Those were all the mantras repeating in my head until I was 27. I spent all of my 20s trying to get there only to find out, now turning 30, that there is no \"there.\"</p> <p>I wrote that piece thinking if it helped my sister, it would be worth it. If I shared it, maybe it would help someone and save them the trouble I went through.</p> <p>But I was surprised at the reception. Everyone took something different from it. Older men told me that they resonated with the cost of being a champion and the importance of separating goodness and greatness.</p> <p>Students told me it was about imposter syndrome.</p> <p>Some thought it was about inverted thinking and the value of being by yourself.And part of that felt really healing. When I got a C in Grade 10 English, my English teacher said it was fine because I was an ESL student. I thought with a grade like that, I wouldn't be able to get into college. When I went to Waterloo, I also failed the entry English exam, IELTS.</p> <p>I had always accepted it as being an immigrant and always struggling to express myself because I spent so much time by myself. It was like some scar tissue from my childhood. I had no choice in the matter.</p> <p>So I believe that many of the kind words I received healed a bit of that. Not only could I express myself, but I was also worth listening to.</p> <p>But I think the greatest compliment came from you.</p> <p>For you to believe that the only way someone could have written what I wrote was for me to have been a privileged optimist who was given everything in life.</p> <p>It must mean that the lies I told myself worked. Not only am I trying to choose happiness, but I was also able to fool myself and others too, so I must have carried my struggles well.</p> <p>You were a mirror that helped me see myself. I hope one day you can see yourself in my words too.</p> <p>I'll end this with quote from Naval, for <code>hsrob1</code>.</p> <p>If you despise the wealthy, it will elude you.</p> <p>I used to hate rich people too.</p> <p>ps: Its not just about wealth.</p>"},{"location":"writing/2024/01/11/anatomy-of-a-tweet/","title":"Anatomy of a Tweet","text":"<p>The last two posts were hard to write, so this one is easy, but it gets my words in for the day.

Improving the quality of the tweets is also important and may have a significant impact, but is hard to consistently replicate.</li> <li>On the other hand, the path to reaching 1M followers is likely to be very different from the path to 50k followers. While its sitll likely that 1M tweets can get you to 1M followers, its more likely that you will need different set of strategies to get there.</li> </ol> <p>I believe this is true in the same way that the technical skills required to make $100k versus $10M are vastly different. It's essentially transitioning from trading time for money to acquiring talent, building systems, and scaling. For example, I could hire a writing team to produce more content and increase my output. I can also leverage affiliates and encourage people to share my content, which can help in reaching a wider audience. Additionally, being promoted by larger accounts, like when I was retweeted by llama index and LangChain, can significantly boost visibility and follower count.</p> <p>This more about business in general</p> <p>I want to emphasize that this knowledge applies only to my own place in the journey.

My parents were the children of rural farmers who grew up during the Cultural Revolution. They were the first generation of their family to read and write, and also the first generation to leave the village.</p> <p>Growing up, I had always been interested in art and science. In high school, I went to a public art school and studied digital animation and design for 4 years. Then, in college, I went to Waterloo to study mathematical physics. By the second year, I met a guy named TC who was clearly much smarter than me, so I decided to do something else. At that time, I learned to code through dating this girl Christine. I took Andrew Ng's machine learning course and got hooked.</p> <p>Physics timelines were too long for me, so I switched to machine learning and focused my interests on social networks and understanding how humans interact with each other. In the process, I generated massive volumes of data that could be used to train models and understand human behavior. This led me to do the research I had done at NYU and then at Facebook.</p> <p>I thought my dream would have been to study computational social science at Facebook, but due to the politics around online safety, the role of the data scientist at the organization, and the bloat of middle management, I decided that I didn't want to be part of the system, so I left. And joined my mentor Chris Moody and my friend Thomas Miller at Stitch Fix.</p> <p>There, I spent the first 2 years working on vision-based models, fine-tuning multimodal embedding models for clothing and fashion understanding, a range of classification, retrieval, bounding box, and recommendation system problems. As I became more senior and the team grew, I started to focus more on the infrastructure and platform side of things. I built a framework called Flight, which is a framework for building and executing pipelines. It's a semantic bridge that integrates multiple systems within Stitch Fix. It provides modular operator classes for data scientists to develop and offers three levels of user experience.
